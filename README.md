ICAS is an automation platform, which helps accelerate Automation-adoption by promoting reuse of components at an atomic task level. Based on MicroBOT architecture, the ever-growing repository has 500+ reusable MicroBOTs, built using multiple in-house and third party automation platforms. These MicroBOTs are designed strategically by identifying most common IT &amp; Business activities and breaking them into micro tasks. These are applicable across all industry domains and business functions. ICAS comes with an integrated Orchestrator, which enables sequencing multiple MicroBOTs (from heterogeneous technologies) to create a Worker BOT that can perform an end-to-end process automation. Multiple such Worker BOTs can be set to execute using a common digital identity called Digital Worker, which collectively forms the Digital Workforce.
